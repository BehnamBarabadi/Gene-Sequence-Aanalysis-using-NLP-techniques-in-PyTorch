# Gene-Sequence-Aanalysis-using-NLP-techniques-in-PyTorch

This repo is my work during my internship as a data scientist in a Biotech startup called VastBiome.
I was responsible for redesigning the machine learning pipeline from scratch to classify patients' responses to an available gut cancer drug. I used different NLP techniques in PyTorch and also I worked on Model Interpretebility in PyTorch.
The poster of my work is accepted for NVIDIA GTC conferenece 2021. (Below you can see it)
